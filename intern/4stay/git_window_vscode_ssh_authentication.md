You've successfully authenticated, but Github does not provide shell access.
===

### Reason
ssh authenticated file in window local does not exist, or file is invalid

### Solution
1. Find local ssh authenticated file <br>
`C:\Users\uname\.ssh\`
2. If there are no rsa or ed files, you should make new ssh authentication file <br>
FYI, I have TIL file for this problem
3. Set the same rsa file in Ubuntu on Window local ssh directory
